# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Multiplayer Collision and Debris System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the system for player-vs-player collisions and persistent debris generation.
# Details:
In the server GameRoom, implement collision detection between player rockets. On collision, destroy both rockets and generate debris physics bodies. Add debris to the state schema for synchronization. In the client, implement visual effects for explosions and debris rendering. Ensure debris persists in the simulation and affects other players.

# Test Strategy:
Test player-vs-player collisions with different velocities and angles. Verify debris generation and persistence. Check that debris correctly affects other players through collisions. Test with multiple simultaneous collisions.
