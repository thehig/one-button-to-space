# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Comprehensive Test Suite for Matter.js Physics Engine
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a robust test suite for the shared physics engine that verifies deterministic behavior across basic actions, environmental effects, and celestial scale physics simulations.
# Details:
Create a comprehensive test framework for our Matter.js-based physics engine with the following components:

1. **Basic Action Tests**:
   - Implement tests for directional commands (turn_left, turn_right, etc.) that verify exact angle changes
   - Test thrust_on/thrust_off commands with precise acceleration and velocity measurements
   - Verify collision detection and response with different object shapes and masses
   - Test object creation/destruction and its effects on the simulation

2. **Environmental Effect Tests**:
   - Create tests for atmospheric drag that verify velocity reduction over time matches expected values
   - Implement heating tests that confirm temperature changes based on velocity, atmospheric density, and material properties
   - Test wind/current effects on objects of different shapes and masses
   - Verify that all environmental effects scale properly with time step variations

3. **Celestial Physics Tests**:
   - Implement gravitational tests between large bodies with known analytical solutions
   - Test orbital mechanics including stable orbits, orbital decay, and n-body problems
   - Verify conservation of energy and momentum in closed systems
   - Test extreme scale differences (e.g., spacecraft near planets)

4. **Determinism Verification**:
   - Create a test harness that runs simulations multiple times with identical inputs
   - Implement exact state comparison tools that verify positions, velocities, and forces match precisely across runs
   - Test determinism across different hardware and JavaScript engines

Use snapshot testing where appropriate to capture expected states. All tests should run automatically in CI/CD pipeline.

# Test Strategy:
The test implementation should follow these verification approaches:

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Create isolated tests for each physics component using Jest or Mocha
   - Use precise numerical comparisons with appropriate epsilon values for floating-point operations
   - Mock dependencies where needed to isolate specific physics behaviors

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Develop scenarios that combine multiple physics components
   - Create reference scenarios with known outcomes (e.g., projectile motion with drag)
   - Compare simulation results against analytical solutions where possible

3. **Determinism Testing**:
   - Run identical simulations 100+ times and verify bit-exact output
   - Test with different time steps (fixed vs. variable) to ensure consistent results
   - Create a determinism test that saves initial state, runs forward 1000 steps, then backward 1000 steps, and verifies return to initial state

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure execution time for complex scenarios
   - Verify performance remains consistent across identical runs

5. **Regression Testing**:
   - Create a baseline of expected outputs for all test scenarios
   - Automate comparison against these baselines in CI/CD

All tests should include detailed assertions that verify not just that objects move, but that they move exactly as expected with the correct physical properties. Test reports should include visualization capabilities to help debug failed tests.
