# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Web Worker for Physics Calculations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a separate package for a web worker to handle physics calculations off the main thread using Matter.js, implementing the Command design pattern for communication, with independent test harnesses and demo pages to demonstrate functionality.
# Details:
This task involves creating a dedicated package for a web worker that will handle physics calculations using Matter.js to prevent UI blocking and improve performance. The communication between the main thread and worker will follow the Command design pattern. Implementation steps:

1. Create a new package structure (e.g., `physics-worker-package`) with its own build configuration
2. Develop the core worker file (e.g., `physicsWorker.js`) within this package that will handle physics calculations using Matter.js
3. Implement message passing protocol within the worker using the Command design pattern:
   - Define command objects for different operations (e.g., 'initWorld', 'addBody', 'updateSimulation')
   - Create command handlers for each command type
   - Ensure all command objects are properly serializable
4. Create test harnesses within the package to verify worker functionality:
   - Simple test page that initializes the worker with Matter.js
   - Performance comparison tests (with/without worker)
   - Command execution validation tests
5. Develop demo pages that showcase the worker's capabilities:
   - Basic Matter.js physics simulation using only the worker
   - Visual representation of calculations being performed off-main thread
   - Performance metrics display
6. Document the API and command protocol for future integration
7. Implement error handling for worker communication
8. Add a fallback mechanism if web workers aren't supported
9. Create package export configuration to make the worker easily importable

Considerations:
- Package should be completely independent and testable on its own
- Ensure data passed to workers is serializable (no functions or complex objects)
- Be mindful of the overhead of data transfer between threads
- Consider using SharedArrayBuffer for large data sets if browser support allows
- Design with future integration in mind, but focus on standalone functionality first
- Include proper documentation for future integration with the client package
- Properly wrap Matter.js functionality within the Command pattern structure

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both functionality and performance improvements within the standalone package:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test worker initialization and termination with Matter.js
   - Verify command execution with mock physics data
   - Test error handling when worker communication fails
   - Validate all command types and their handlers
   - Test Matter.js integration points

2. Package Tests:
   - Verify the package can be properly imported and initialized
   - Test the package's public API
   - Ensure proper bundling and distribution
   - Test Matter.js initialization within the worker context

3. Demo Page Tests:
   - Verify demo pages function correctly across browsers
   - Ensure visualizations accurately represent worker activity
   - Test that performance metrics are accurately reported
   - Validate Matter.js simulations run correctly in the worker

4. Performance Tests:
   - Create benchmarks comparing Matter.js calculations on main thread vs worker
   - Measure overhead of command pattern message passing
   - Test with various payload sizes to determine optimal data transfer strategies
   - Benchmark different types of physics simulations

5. Browser Compatibility:
   - Test across different browsers to ensure worker support
   - Verify fallback mechanism works in environments without worker support
   - Test Matter.js compatibility in different browser environments

6. Documentation Testing:
   - Review API documentation for clarity and completeness
   - Verify integration instructions are accurate
   - Ensure command protocol is well-documented for future integration
   - Validate Matter.js-specific documentation

Here's additional information for integrating Matter.js with the Command Pattern:

```javascript
// Command structure example
class PhysicsCommand {
  constructor(type, payload) {
    this.type = type;
    this.payload = payload;
  }
  
  static serialize(command) {
    return JSON.stringify(command);
  }
  
  static deserialize(message) {
    return JSON.parse(message);
  }
}

// Sample command implementations
class InitWorldCommand extends PhysicsCommand {
  constructor(width, height, gravity) {
    super('INIT_WORLD', { width, height, gravity });
  }
  
  execute(engine) {
    engine.world.bounds = { 
      min: { x: 0, y: 0 }, 
      max: { x: this.payload.width, y: this.payload.height } 
    };
    engine.world.gravity = this.payload.gravity;
    return { success: true, worldId: engine.world.id };
  }
}

// Command executor implementation
class CommandExecutor {
  constructor() {
    this.engine = Matter.Engine.create();
    this.commandMap = {
      'INIT_WORLD': (payload) => this.initWorld(payload),
      'ADD_BODY': (payload) => this.addBody(payload),
      'STEP_SIMULATION': (payload) => this.stepSimulation(payload),
      // Additional commands...
    };
  }
  
  execute(command) {
    const handler = this.commandMap[command.type];
    if (!handler) {
      return { error: `Unknown command type: ${command.type}` };
    }
    
    try {
      return handler(command.payload);
    } catch (error) {
      return { error: error.message };
    }
  }
  
  // Handler implementations...
}

// Worker message handling
self.addEventListener('message', (event) => {
  const command = PhysicsCommand.deserialize(event.data);
  const executor = new CommandExecutor();
  const result = executor.execute(command);
  self.postMessage(PhysicsCommand.serialize(result));
});
```

Performance considerations:
- Use transferable objects (ArrayBuffer) for large data transfers to avoid copying
- Implement body batching for adding multiple physics objects at once
- Create a caching mechanism for frequently accessed physics objects
- Consider using a fixed time step for simulation stability
- Implement spatial partitioning for collision detection optimization
- Add throttling mechanisms for high-frequency updates
