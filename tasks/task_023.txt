# Task ID: 23
# Title: Implement Web Worker for Physics Calculations
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a separate package for a web worker to handle physics calculations off the main thread, with independent test harnesses and demo pages to demonstrate functionality.
# Details:
This task involves creating a dedicated package for a web worker that will handle physics calculations to prevent UI blocking and improve performance. Implementation steps:

1. Create a new package structure (e.g., `physics-worker-package`) with its own build configuration
2. Develop the core worker file (e.g., `physicsWorker.js`) within this package that will handle physics calculations
3. Implement message passing protocol within the worker:
   - Define clear message types (e.g., 'init', 'update', 'calculate')
   - Create handlers for each message type
   - Ensure all data is properly serializable
4. Create test harnesses within the package to verify worker functionality:
   - Simple test page that initializes the worker
   - Performance comparison tests (with/without worker)
   - Message passing validation tests
5. Develop demo pages that showcase the worker's capabilities:
   - Basic physics simulation using only the worker
   - Visual representation of calculations being performed off-main thread
   - Performance metrics display
6. Document the API and message protocol for future integration
7. Implement error handling for worker communication
8. Add a fallback mechanism if web workers aren't supported
9. Create package export configuration to make the worker easily importable

Considerations:
- Package should be completely independent and testable on its own
- Ensure data passed to workers is serializable (no functions or complex objects)
- Be mindful of the overhead of data transfer between threads
- Consider using SharedArrayBuffer for large data sets if browser support allows
- Design with future integration in mind, but focus on standalone functionality first
- Include proper documentation for future integration with the client package

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both functionality and performance improvements within the standalone package:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Test worker initialization and termination
   - Verify message passing with mock physics data
   - Test error handling when worker communication fails
   - Validate all message types and their handlers

2. Package Tests:
   - Verify the package can be properly imported and initialized
   - Test the package's public API
   - Ensure proper bundling and distribution

3. Demo Page Tests:
   - Verify demo pages function correctly across browsers
   - Ensure visualizations accurately represent worker activity
   - Test that performance metrics are accurately reported

4. Performance Tests:
   - Create benchmarks comparing calculations on main thread vs worker
   - Measure overhead of message passing
   - Test with various payload sizes to determine optimal data transfer strategies

5. Browser Compatibility:
   - Test across different browsers to ensure worker support
   - Verify fallback mechanism works in environments without worker support

6. Documentation Testing:
   - Review API documentation for clarity and completeness
   - Verify integration instructions are accurate
   - Ensure message protocol is well-documented for future integration
