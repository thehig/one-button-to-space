# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Cargo System and Physics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the cargo system with pickup, transport, and delivery mechanics.
# Details:
Design and implement cargo items as distinct physics entities. Create internal cargo bay mechanics for storing items. Implement external cargo attachment using constraints (ropes, springs) in the physics engine. Develop pickup mechanics that allow the player to collect cargo when in proximity. Create delivery mechanics that detect when cargo has been successfully transported to a destination. Implement visual feedback for cargo status (picked up, attached, delivered).

# Test Strategy:
Test that cargo items behave as expected under physics simulation. Verify that cargo can be picked up when the rocket is in the correct position. Test that attached cargo affects the rocket's handling. Ensure cargo delivery is correctly detected when items reach their destination.
