# Task ID: 6
# Title: Enhance NetworkManager with physics synchronization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3, 4, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Extend the existing NetworkManager to handle sending inputs to the server and receiving/reconciling physics state updates.
# Details:
1. Enhance the existing NetworkManager or create a new one that integrates with the shared physics
2. Implement input sending to server with timestamps
3. Add state reception from server
4. Implement client-side prediction using the shared physics engine
5. Add state reconciliation when server updates are received
6. Implement interpolation for remote player entities
7. Add lag compensation techniques
8. Create debug visualization of prediction/reconciliation

# Test Strategy:
Test with artificial network conditions (latency, packet loss) using the Network Condition panel in Chrome DevTools. Verify smooth movement under various network conditions. Create a test that deliberately causes prediction errors to verify reconciliation works.
