# Task ID: 2
# Title: Implement shared Matter.js physics core
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core deterministic physics simulation using Matter.js in the shared package that will be used by both client and server.
# Details:
1. Install Matter.js and its TypeScript types in the shared package
2. Create a PhysicsEngine class that encapsulates Matter.js setup and configuration
3. Implement fixed timestep physics update loop
4. Create physics body factory methods for rockets and other game objects
5. Define collision categories and groups
6. Implement gravity simulation that varies based on proximity to celestial bodies
7. Add atmospheric effects (density, drag)
8. Create utility functions for applying forces and impulses
9. Ensure deterministic behavior by avoiding random values or time-dependent calculations

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for the physics engine with predictable inputs and expected outputs. Verify deterministic behavior by running the same simulation multiple times with identical inputs.
