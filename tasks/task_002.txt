# Task ID: 2
# Title: Configure TypeScript for All Packages
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up TypeScript configuration for client, server, and shared packages with strict type checking.
# Details:
Create a base tsconfig.json in the root directory with strict type checking enabled. Create extended tsconfig.json files in each package directory that reference the base config and add package-specific settings. For client, configure for React/Vite. For server, configure for Node.js. For shared, configure for cross-environment compatibility. Install TypeScript and related type definitions as dev dependencies.

# Test Strategy:
Run 'tsc --noEmit' in each package to verify TypeScript configuration is valid. Create simple test files in each package to ensure compilation works correctly.
