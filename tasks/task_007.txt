# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement server-side physics with Matter.js
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate the shared Matter.js physics engine into the Colyseus server rooms for authoritative simulation.
# Details:
1. Create or modify GameRoom class to use the shared physics engine
2. Set up fixed timestep update loop in the room
3. Process player inputs and apply them to physics bodies
4. Update the room state schema with physics body states
5. Implement collision handling and event dispatching
6. Add server-side validation of client inputs
7. Optimize state broadcasting (delta compression, interest management)
8. Implement server-side game logic that depends on physics (landing detection, mission objectives)

# Test Strategy:
Create test clients that connect to the server and verify physics simulation is consistent between client and server. Test with multiple simultaneous clients to ensure server performance.
