# Task ID: 7
# Title: Implement Client-Side Manager Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core manager classes for the client-side game architecture.
# Details:
Implement the manager classes as specified in the PRD: PhysicsManager (integrating with shared physics), InputManager, NetworkManager, EntityManager, CameraManager, UIManager, and AudioManager. Each manager should have clear lifecycle methods (init, create/start, update, shutdown/destroy). Set up dependency injection between managers. Implement an event bus system using Phaser's event emitters for communication between managers. Ensure proper cleanup in shutdown/destroy methods.

# Test Strategy:
Create test scenarios that exercise each manager's functionality. Verify managers initialize, update, and clean up correctly. Test event communication between managers. Verify Hot Module Replacement works without memory leaks.
