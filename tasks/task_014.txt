# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement cargo system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 13
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a system for picking up, attaching, and delivering cargo items with physics effects.
# Details:
1. Create cargo entity types with physics properties
2. Implement cargo pickup mechanics
3. Add cargo attachment to rockets with physics constraints
4. Create cargo delivery detection
5. Implement cargo-specific missions
6. Add cargo UI elements
7. Create cargo loading/unloading animations
8. Implement cargo damage mechanics

# Test Strategy:
Test cargo pickup, attachment, and delivery with various rocket types and cargo sizes. Verify physics effects of attached cargo. Test cargo missions and delivery detection.
