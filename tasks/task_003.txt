# Task ID: 3
# Title: Set Up Client Package with Vite and React
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the client package with Vite, React, and TypeScript support.
# Details:
In the client directory, initialize a new Vite project with React and TypeScript template using 'pnpm create vite . --template react-ts'. Configure vite.config.ts for development and production builds. Set up basic React component structure. Install necessary dependencies including React, React DOM, and Vite. Create a simple App component and entry point to verify setup.

# Test Strategy:
Run 'pnpm dev' in the client package to verify the Vite development server starts correctly. Confirm the React application renders in the browser without errors.
