# Task ID: 3
# Title: Define shared constants and types
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create shared constants, event names, and TypeScript interfaces/types to be used across client and server.
# Details:
1. Define physics constants (gravity, atmospheric density, etc.)
2. Create event name constants for the event bus
3. Define collision category constants
4. Create TypeScript interfaces for game entities (Rocket, Debris, etc.)
5. Define input action types (thrust_start, rotate_left, etc.)
6. Create network message types
7. Define scene keys and asset keys
8. Create mission and objective type definitions

# Test Strategy:
Verify constants and types can be imported and used correctly in both client and server code. Run TypeScript compilation to ensure type safety.
