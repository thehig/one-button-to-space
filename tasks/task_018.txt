# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Game Engine Architecture with Variable Update Rates and Layered Rendering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a foundational client-side architecture that separates physics, logic, and rendering into independent update loops with different rates, while organizing game objects into a scene management system with separate render layers.
# Details:
This task involves restructuring the client-side game engine to follow best practices for 2D game development, performance and maintainability:

1. Variable Update Rate System:
   - Implement a time management system that tracks delta time between frames
   - Create separate update loops for game logic (fixed timestep) and rendering (variable, potentially V-sync limited)
   - Implement interpolation between states for smooth rendering at higher framerates
   - Design a central TimeManager class to provide timing information to all systems

2. Scene/State Management:
   - Create a SceneManager class that maintains a collection of active game objects
   - Implement scene loading/unloading functionality with proper resource management
   - Design a state transition system for different game states (menu, gameplay, etc.)
   - Add support for hierarchical object relationships (parent-child transforms)

3. Dedicated Update Manager:
   - Develop an UpdateManager that orchestrates the execution order of systems
   - Implement component registration for different update phases (early, standard, late)
   - Create a priority system for controlling update sequence within each phase
   - Add support for pausing specific systems independently

4. Layered Rendering:
   - Separate rendering into distinct layers (specifically game world and UI/HUD)
   - Ensure UI elements remain fixed while game camera moves
   - Create a camera system that can render to specific layers
   - Design a compositing system to combine layers with appropriate blending

5. 2D Game Development Best Practices:
   - Implement efficient sprite batching for improved rendering performance
   - Create a robust collision detection system appropriate for 2D games
   - Design a flexible animation system for sprite-based animations
   - Implement proper camera controls and viewport management for 2D space

6. Code Cleanup and Organization:
   - Enforce consistent naming conventions and code style
   - Implement proper memory management with appropriate patterns
   - Add comprehensive error handling and logging
   - Ensure systems use interfaces/abstract classes for better decoupling
   - Document all major systems with clear API documentation

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both individual components and their integration:

1. Time and Update Rate Testing:
   - Unit test the TimeManager to ensure accurate delta time calculation
   - Verify logic updates occur at fixed intervals regardless of frame rate
   - Test rendering at different frame rates (30, 60, 144 fps) to confirm smooth motion
   - Create a visualization tool that displays the actual update rates of each system
   - Stress test with intentional frame drops to ensure stability

2. Scene/State Management Testing:
   - Verify objects are correctly added to and removed from scenes
   - Test state transitions for memory leaks and proper resource cleanup
   - Benchmark scene loading times with different numbers of objects
   - Verify parent-child relationships maintain proper transformations

3. Update System Testing:
   - Create mock components that log their update order
   - Verify components execute in the correct sequence based on priority
   - Test pausing specific systems while others continue
   - Measure performance impact of the update manager overhead

4. Render Layer Testing:
   - Create a test scene with objects on different layers (game world vs HUD)
   - Verify UI elements remain fixed while game camera moves
   - Test proper layering of game elements and UI components
   - Verify performance with many objects across different layers

5. 2D Specific Testing:
   - Test sprite batching performance with varying numbers of sprites
   - Verify collision detection accuracy and performance
   - Test animation system with different sprite-based animations
   - Verify camera controls and viewport management in 2D space

6. Integration Testing:
   - Create a benchmark scene that exercises all systems together
   - Profile CPU/GPU usage to identify bottlenecks
   - Test on different hardware configurations
   - Implement automated tests that verify the correct interaction between all systems
