Create a CommunicationManager class responsible for:\n   - Capturing events from multiple sources including:\n     - The Phaser game's `Phaser.Events.EventEmitter` instance\n     - Individual game scene event emitters\n     - Network event emitters\n     - Any other relevant event emitters in the system\n   - Tagging events by their source (e.g., \"Game\", \"Scene\", \"Network\")\n   - Maintaining an efficient, potentially rolling, chronological log of events to handle high event volume\n   - Providing this data to React components via a React Context Provider\n   - Serving as the central hub for all Phaser-to-React data transfer\n\n2. Implement a React Context Provider that:\n   - Wraps the CommunicationManager functionality\n   - Exposes the event log data to React components\n   - Provides methods for filtering and clearing the log\n\n3. Create the GameEventLog component that:\n   - Consumes the event data from the React Context Provider\n   - Maintains no internal event state (relies on the Context Provider)\n   - Implements UI controls for filtering events by:\n     - Source emitter (e.g., show only network events)\n     - Event name/type\n     - Event data/value\n   - Renders the events as a scrollable list showing:\n     - Event timestamp\n     - Source tag\n     - Event name/type\n     - Relevant event data in a readable format\n   - Includes a clear button to reset the event log through the Context Provider\n   - Uses basic styling to make the log visually distinct\n\n4. Ensure the CommunicationManager:\n   - Employs a clear architectural pattern (e.g., Observer, Pub/Sub) for decoupling event sources and consumers\n   - Subscribes to all emitters when initialized and unsubscribes when destroyed\n   - Implements a maximum number of events to store (e.g., 50) to prevent performance issues\n   - Provides efficient filtering capabilities\n   - Prioritizes clarity, testability, and maintainability in the implementation\n\n5. All Phaser-to-React communication should flow through the CommunicationManager, not directly to the React components.\n\nThe component should be flexible enough to handle different event types without errors and should display the source tags provided by the CommunicationManager.",
