Import `CommunicationManager`, `EventLogEntry`, and necessary Vitest functions (`describe`, `it`, `expect`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, `vi`).\n2.  Use `beforeEach` and `afterEach` to manage the singleton instance:\n    *   `beforeEach`: Reset Vitest mocks (`vi.resetModules()`), dynamically import `CommunicationManager` to get a fresh module scope, get the instance. Mock `Date.now()` for consistent timestamps. Mock `window` and `window.__console_log_original`.\n    *   `afterEach`: Call `CommunicationManager.getInstance().destroy()` to clean up listeners, explicitly delete the static instance (`delete (CommunicationManager as any).instance;`) to ensure isolation. Restore mocks (`vi.restoreAllMocks()`).\n\n**Test Cases:**\n\n1.  **Singleton Pattern (`getInstance`)**:\n    *   `it('should return the same instance')`: Call `getInstance()` multiple times and assert the returned objects are strictly equal.\n    *   `it('should create a new instance if none exists')`: Verify instance creation on first call.\n\n2.  **`logEvent` Method**:\n    *   `it('should add a log entry with correct structure')`: Call `logEvent`, then `getEventLog`, check array length and the structure/content of the added entry (timestamp, source, eventName, data).\n    *   `it('should emit \"new-event\" with the log entry')`: Spy on `emit`, call `logEvent`, verify `emit` was called with `'new-event'` and the correct entry.\n    *   `it('should handle different data types (object, array, primitive, null)')`: Test `logEvent` with various data types and verify they are stored correctly.\n    *   `it('should trim the log when maxLogSize is exceeded')`: Set `maxLogSize` low, add more events than the limit, verify `getEventLog` returns only the last N entries. Check trimming behavior (should keep *last* N).\n    *   `it('should redirect to original console.log when enabled')`: Set `redirectEventsToConsole(true)`, mock `window.__console_log_original`, spy on it, call `logEvent`, verify the mock was called with correct formatting.\n    *   `it('should not redirect to console when disabled')`: Set `redirectEventsToConsole(false)`, spy on mock `window.__console_log_original`, verify it was NOT called.\n\n3.  **`clearLog` Method**:\n    *   `it('should clear the event log')`: Add events, call `clearLog`, verify `getEventLog` returns an empty array.\n    *   `it('should emit \"log-cleared\" event')`: Spy on `emit`, call `clearLog`, verify `emit` was called with `'log-cleared'`. \n\n4.  **Event Listeners (`on`, `off`, `emit`)**:\n    *   `it('should register and trigger event listeners using \"on\"')`: Register a listener using `on`, `emit` the event, verify the listener callback was executed.\n    *   `it('should remove event listeners using \"off\"')`: Register a listener, remove it using `off`, emit the event, verify the listener was NOT called.\n\n5.  **Configuration (`setMaxLogSize`, `setRedirectEventsToConsole`)**:\n    *   `it('should update maxLogSize')`: Call `setMaxLogSize`, check the internal `_maxLogSize` (or use the getter `maxLogSize`) and verify it trims the log immediately if needed. Test with valid and invalid (negative, zero) inputs, ensuring validation works.\n    *   `it('should log the maxLogSize change')`: Spy on `logEvent`, call `setMaxLogSize`, verify `logEvent` was called with appropriate details.\n    *   `it('should update redirectEventsToConsole flag')`: Call `setRedirectEventsToConsole`, check internal `_redirectEventsToConsole` state.\n    *   `it('should log the redirect change only when value changes')`: Spy on `logEvent`, call `setRedirectEventsToConsole` multiple times (true -> false -> false -> true), verify `logEvent` is called only when the state actually changes.\n\n6.  **`getEventLog` Method**:\n    *   `it('should return a copy of the event log array')`: Get the log, modify the returned array, get the log again, verify the internal log wasn't changed (defensive copy).\n    *   `it('should return the current log entries')`: Add events, call `getEventLog`, verify the contents match expected.\n\n7.  **`destroy` Method**:\n    *   `it('should remove all listeners')`: Add listeners, call `destroy`, emit events, verify listeners are not called. (Check `listenerCount` goes to 0).\n    *   `it('should potentially clean up other resources (if any added later)')` - Placeholder if needed.\n\n**Mocks:**\n*   `vi.spyOn(CommunicationManager.prototype, 'emit')`\n*   `vi.spyOn(console, 'log')` / `window.__console_log_original` (mock implementation)\n*   `vi.useFakeTimers()` and `vi.setSystemTime()` for consistent timestamps in `Date.now()`.\n*   Mock `window` object as needed for console redirection tests.\n</info added on 2025-05-05T20:48:25.645Z>",

Write integration guides for using the package\n4. Document Matter.js integration points and configuration options\n5. Document performance considerations and best practices\n6. Configure package exports in package.json\n7. Create TypeScript type definitions if applicable\n8. Add examples of common integration patterns\n9. Document browser compatibility and fallback behavior\n10. Create changelog and versioning strategy\n11. Finalize README with installation, usage, and contribution guidelines\n\nTesting approach:\n- Verify documentation accuracy by following integration steps in a test project\n- Test package import in different project types (vanilla JS, React, etc.)\n- Review documentation for completeness and clarity\n- Ensure all exports are accessible as documented\n- Validate Matter.js-specific documentation\n\n<info added on 2025-05-07T20:07:02.350Z>\nAdditional documentation requirements:\n\nMatter.js Worker Documentation:\n- Document the specific Matter.js engine configuration options supported in the worker context\n- Include limitations of running Matter.js in a worker (e.g., no direct DOM access)\n- Detail how rendering data is transferred from worker to main thread\n- Document any performance optimizations specific to Matter.js in workers\n- Explain how to debug physics simulations running in the worker\n\nCommand Object Documentation:\n- Create a comprehensive command reference table with columns for:\n  * Command name\n  * Required and optional parameters with types\n  * Return values/events\n  * Error conditions\n  * Performance considerations\n- Include serialization/deserialization details for complex physics objects\n- Document the timing and synchronization mechanisms between frames\n\nIntegration Examples:\n- Provide code samples for common physics scenarios (collisions, constraints, etc.)\n- Include examples of handling physics events from the worker\n- Add diagrams showing the communication flow between main thread and worker\n- Create a troubleshooting section with common integration issues and solutions\n- Provide performance comparison metrics with and without worker implementation\n</info added on 2025-05-07T20:07:02.350Z>",
