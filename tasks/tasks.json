Implement information panels layout:\n   - Create collapsible/expandable panels\n   - Ensure proper spacing and alignment\n6. Add responsive behavior for mobile devices:\n   - Adjust controls for touch interfaces\n   - Implement mobile-friendly layout changes\n7. Ensure all UI elements maintain proper positioning during resizing\n\nTesting approach:\n- Test layout at various screen sizes\n- Verify panels resize and reposition correctly\n- Check that the layout matches the current visualizer's appearance\n- Test on different devices and browsers\n- Ensure touch controls work on mobile devices",

Finalize the Vite build configuration:\n   - Configure proper output formats (ESM, CJS if needed)\n   - Set up tree-shaking and code splitting\n   - Optimize asset handling\n   - Configure environment variables\n2. Update package.json:\n   - Add all necessary scripts for development and building\n   - Ensure proper peer dependencies are listed\n   - Configure package exports to not interfere with existing code\n3. Perform comprehensive testing of all features:\n   - Verify all existing visualizer features work in the React version\n   - Test performance compared to the original implementation\n   - Ensure all scenarios load and run correctly\n4. Create documentation:\n   - Write a detailed README.md in the new directory covering:\n     - Project overview and architecture decisions\n     - Component structure and relationships\n     - State management approach\n     - How to run/build the visualizer\n     - How to extend with new components\n     - Migration strategy and rationale\n   - Add inline code documentation for complex logic\n   - Create example usage snippets\n5. Implement any final optimizations:\n   - Performance improvements\n   - Code cleanup\n   - Accessibility enhancements\n\nTesting approach:\n- Perform end-to-end testing of the complete visualizer\n- Verify build output works when imported\n- Check documentation for completeness and accuracy\n- Ensure all existing features are preserved and working correctly\n- Validate that no physics engine code was modified",
