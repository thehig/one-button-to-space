# Task ID: 8
# Title: Create EntityManager for game objects
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement an EntityManager to create, track, update, and destroy game entities (rockets, debris, etc.) and synchronize them with physics bodies.
# Details:
1. Create EntityManager class in the client
2. Implement entity creation, tracking, and destruction
3. Set up synchronization with PhysicsManager
4. Create factory methods for different entity types (rockets, debris, etc.)
5. Implement entity pooling for performance
6. Add entity component system (ECS) architecture
7. Create components for position, velocity, renderable, physics body, etc.
8. Implement systems that operate on entities with specific components

# Test Strategy:
Create a test scene with multiple entity types. Verify entities are correctly created, updated, and destroyed. Test performance with a large number of entities.
