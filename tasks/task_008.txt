# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement PhysicsManager Integration with Shared Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Connect the client-side PhysicsManager with the shared physics module.
# Details:
In the PhysicsManager, import and instantiate the physics engine from the shared package. Implement methods to create, update, and render physics bodies. Create a bridge between Phaser's update loop and the fixed timestep physics simulation. Add debug rendering capabilities for physics bodies. Ensure proper synchronization between physics bodies and their visual representations.

# Test Strategy:
Test physics simulation with various scenarios (gravity, collisions, etc.). Verify visual representations match physics body positions and rotations. Check that the fixed timestep implementation maintains consistent simulation regardless of frame rate.
