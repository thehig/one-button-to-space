# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement multiplayer collision and debris system
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a system for handling player-vs-player collisions and generating persistent debris that affects gameplay.
# Details:
1. Enhance server-side collision detection for player rockets
2. Implement explosion mechanics when rockets collide
3. Generate debris physics bodies on collision
4. Add debris to the room state schema for synchronization
5. Create client-side rendering for debris
6. Implement debris lifetime management
7. Add collision effects (particles, sound)
8. Ensure debris affects gameplay by creating hazards for other players

# Test Strategy:
Test with multiple clients and force collisions. Verify debris is generated, synchronized across clients, and persists appropriately. Test collision detection accuracy and performance with many objects.
