# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Audio and Visual Polish
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 9
# Priority: low
# Description: Add sound effects, basic visual effects, and polish the overall presentation.
# Details:
Source or create 8-bit style sound effects for thrust, collisions, and mission events. Implement background music loops suitable for the space/retro theme. Add visual effects for key events (thrust, landing, mission completion). Improve the visual representation of the rocket, terrain, and objects using simple geometric shapes. Implement screen transitions between game states. Add basic animations for interactive elements.

# Test Strategy:
Test that sound effects play correctly for corresponding game events. Verify that music loops seamlessly. Ensure visual effects enhance rather than distract from gameplay. Test the overall presentation for consistency and polish through user feedback.
