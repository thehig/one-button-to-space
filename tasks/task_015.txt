# Task ID: 15
# Title: Refactor Project to Monorepo Workspace Structure
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Migrate client, server, and shared code into a monorepo structure using npm/yarn/pnpm workspaces for better code sharing and dependency management. Original files have been moved to a 'monorepo-conversion' directory to ensure a clean workspace.
# Details:
## Implementation Steps:

1. **Setup Root Configuration**
   - Create/update root package.json with workspace definition (e.g., `"workspaces": ["packages/*"]`)
   - Set up base tsconfig.json with common compiler options
   - Add .gitignore for node_modules at root and package levels

2. **Create Packages Structure**
   - Create packages/ directory at project root
   - Create subdirectories: packages/client/, packages/server/, packages/shared/

3. **Migrate Client Code**
   - Copy relevant client code from monorepo-conversion/src/ to packages/client/src/
   - Copy client assets from monorepo-conversion/public/ to packages/client/public/
   - Create client package.json with appropriate dependencies (reference original package.json)
   - Add dependency on shared package (e.g., `"@one-button-to-space/shared": "*"`)
   - Create client-specific tsconfig.json extending from root
   - Update build paths and scripts

4. **Migrate Server Code**
   - Copy server code from monorepo-conversion/server/ to packages/server/src/
   - Create server package.json with appropriate dependencies (reference original package.json)
   - Add dependency on shared package
   - Create server-specific tsconfig.json extending from root
   - Update build paths and scripts

5. **Set Up Shared Package**
   - Copy shared code from monorepo-conversion/shared/ to packages/shared/src/
   - Create package.json with name `@one-button-to-space/shared`
   - Configure for proper TypeScript declarations
   - Set up build process to generate distributable files

6. **Refactor Import Statements**
   - Update all imports in client and server to use the shared package
   - Replace relative imports (../../shared) with package imports (@one-button-to-space/shared)

7. **Package Installation**
   - Run workspace-aware install from root (npm/yarn/pnpm install)
   - Verify node_modules structure and hoisting

8. **Root Scripts Configuration**
   - Add scripts to root package.json for managing workspaces:
     - `"build": "npm run build --workspaces"`
     - `"dev": "npm run dev --workspaces --parallel"`
     - `"test": "npm run test --workspaces"`
     - Add other workspace management scripts as needed

9. **Update CI/CD Pipeline**
   - Modify CI/CD configuration to work with monorepo structure
   - Update build and deployment scripts

10. **Configuration Files Migration**
    - Review and migrate relevant configuration from monorepo-conversion/config/ to appropriate packages
    - Update paths and references in configuration files to match new structure

11. **Cleanup**
    - After successful testing, remove the temporary monorepo-conversion directory

# Test Strategy:
## Testing Approach:

1. **Build Verification**
   - Run `npm run build` at root level
   - Verify all packages build successfully without errors
   - Check that output directories contain expected files

2. **Functionality Testing**
   - Start both client and server applications
   - Verify all core functionality works as before
   - Test all major user flows to ensure nothing broke during migration
   - Compare behavior with the original implementation in monorepo-conversion directory

3. **Shared Code Propagation Test**
   - Make a change to a type or function in the shared package
   - Rebuild all packages (`npm run build`)
   - Verify the change is correctly reflected in both client and server
   - Test functionality that depends on the modified shared code

4. **Package Dependency Test**
   - Add a new function or type to the shared package
   - Import and use it in both client and server
   - Verify it works correctly in both places

5. **Development Workflow Test**
   - Test the development workflow with the new structure
   - Verify hot reloading works correctly
   - Ensure developers can easily run and test individual packages

6. **CI Pipeline Test**
   - Run the updated CI pipeline
   - Verify all build, test, and deployment steps complete successfully

7. **Side-by-Side Comparison**
   - Run the original application from monorepo-conversion directory
   - Run the new monorepo version
   - Compare functionality, performance, and behavior to ensure equivalence
