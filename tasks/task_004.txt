# Task ID: 4
# Title: Integrate Matter.js with Phaser client
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a PhysicsManager in the client that uses the shared Matter.js simulation and interfaces with Phaser rendering.
# Details:
1. Create a PhysicsManager class in the client
2. Import and instantiate the shared PhysicsEngine
3. Set up synchronization between Matter.js bodies and Phaser game objects
4. Implement debug rendering of physics bodies using Phaser graphics
5. Handle physics body creation and destruction
6. Implement proper cleanup in the shutdown/destroy methods
7. Add the manager to the relevant Phaser scenes
8. Ensure HMR compatibility

# Test Strategy:
Create a test scene that demonstrates physics objects responding to forces and collisions. Verify visual representation matches physics simulation. Test cleanup by switching scenes multiple times.
