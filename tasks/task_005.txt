# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement InputManager for rocket control
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create an InputManager that handles user input (touch/click for thrust, device tilt/keyboard for orientation) and translates it to game actions.
# Details:
1. Create InputManager class in the client
2. Set up event listeners for keyboard, mouse, touch inputs
3. Implement device orientation handling if available
4. Translate raw inputs to abstract game actions (thrust_start, rotate_left, etc.)
5. Emit events via Phaser's event system
6. Implement input buffering for network transmission
7. Add proper cleanup in shutdown/destroy
8. Create input configuration options (sensitivity, key bindings)

# Test Strategy:
Create a test scene that displays input state visually. Verify all input methods work correctly and emit the expected events. Test on both desktop and mobile devices.
