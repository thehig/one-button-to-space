# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Shared Physics Module with Matter.js
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the core physics simulation module in the shared package using Matter.js.
# Details:
In the shared package, install Matter.js and its TypeScript definitions. Create a PhysicsEngine class that encapsulates Matter.js functionality. Implement methods for creating and configuring the physics world, adding/removing bodies, and stepping the simulation with a fixed timestep. Define physics constants (gravity, collision categories, etc.) in a separate constants file. Ensure the implementation is deterministic and can be used identically on both client and server.

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for the physics module to verify deterministic behavior. Run the same simulation with identical inputs on different platforms and compare the results to ensure consistency.
