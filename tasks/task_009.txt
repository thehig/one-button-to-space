# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Basic Level Design and Progression
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a set of initial levels with increasing complexity and implement progression mechanics.
# Details:
Design at least 5 initial levels with varying terrain, gravity conditions, and mission objectives. Implement a level loading system that can instantiate different level configurations. Create a progression system that tracks completed missions and unlocks new locations. Design difficulty curve by gradually introducing more challenging physics scenarios. Implement a level selection interface if multiple missions are available simultaneously.

# Test Strategy:
Test that each level loads correctly with its specific configuration. Verify that the progression system correctly tracks completed missions. Test that new locations and missions unlock as expected. Ensure the difficulty progression feels appropriate through playtesting.
