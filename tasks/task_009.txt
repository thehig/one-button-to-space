# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement rocket control and physics interaction
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a PlayerRocketController that translates input events into forces applied to the rocket's physics body.
# Details:
1. Create PlayerRocketController class
2. Subscribe to input events from InputManager
3. Apply appropriate forces and torques to the rocket's physics body
4. Implement fuel consumption mechanics
5. Add thruster effects tied to input state
6. Implement different rocket types with varying physics properties
7. Add G-force calculation and passenger comfort constraints
8. Implement landing detection and success/failure conditions

# Test Strategy:
Create a test scene that allows manual control of a rocket. Verify rocket responds correctly to inputs and physics forces. Test landing scenarios with different velocities and angles.
