# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Rocket Physics and Control
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the core rocket physics and player control mechanics.
# Details:
In the shared package, define rocket physics properties (mass, thrust force, etc.). Implement rocket body creation in the physics engine. In the client, create a PlayerRocketController that translates input events to physics forces. Implement thrust and orientation control based on input (touch/click for thrust, device tilt or keyboard for orientation). Add visual feedback for thrust activation.

# Test Strategy:
Test rocket movement with different input combinations. Verify physics behavior matches expected rocket dynamics. Check that visual feedback correctly reflects the physics state.
