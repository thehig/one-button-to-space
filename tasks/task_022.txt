# Task ID: 22
# Title: Develop Comprehensive Test Suite for logger-ui Package
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a complete test suite for the logger-ui package that covers hook logic, component rendering, user interactions, and context usage using React Testing Library.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive test suite for the logger-ui package following these requirements:

1. **Hook Testing**:
   - Test all custom hooks in the package (e.g., useLogger, useLoggerContext)
   - Verify hooks properly manage state and respond to changes
   - Test error handling and edge cases
   - **Specific Hook Testing Plan**:
     - **`useComponentLayout`**:
       - Verify layout state management (position, size, visibility)
       - Test initial state, toggle visibility, update position (drag simulation)
       - Test update size (resize simulation) and boundary checks
     - **`useEventFiltering`**:
       - Verify log event filtering logic
       - Test initial state, text filtering (including case sensitivity)
       - Test source filtering, level filtering, combined filters
       - Test filter clearing and input debouncing (if applicable)

2. **Component Testing**:
   - Test all UI components for proper rendering
   - Verify components display correct information based on props
   - Test component lifecycle behaviors
   - Ensure accessibility standards are met
   - **Specific Component Testing Plan**:
     - **`GameEventLog.tsx`**: 
       - Test rendering with prop variations (`startsOpen`, `startsLocked`, `hijackConsoleLogs`, initial layout)
       - Test context wrapping and initial events
       - Verify conditional sections (tree/details)
       - Test visibility/opacity based on state
     - **`TreeNode.tsx`**: 
       - Test rendering with various node structures
       - Test `allowedSources` variations (verify checkbox state)
       - Test `activeSourcesInLog` variations (verify styling)
       - Verify count displays and disabled state

3. **User Interaction Testing**:
   - Test all interactive elements (buttons, inputs, etc.)
   - Verify event handlers are called with correct parameters
   - Test keyboard navigation and shortcuts
   - Simulate user actions and verify expected outcomes
   - **Specific Interaction/Integration Tests (GameEventLog focus)**:
     - **Event Handling:** 
       - Simulate `new-event` from manager -> verify UI updates
       - Test `console.log` hijack -> verify context `logEvent` called & UI updates
       - Test new source event -> verify filter tree updates
     - **Filtering:** 
       - Test text input -> verify list filters
       - Test `TreeNode` checkbox clicks -> verify `allowedSources` updates & list filters
       - Test parent/child checkbox logic
     - **UI Controls:** 
       - Test clear button -> verify `clearLog` called & UI clears
       - Test toggle visibility -> verify state change & window visibility
       - Test lock button -> verify state change & Rnd props toggle
       - Test toggle tree/details -> verify sections visibility
     - **Window Management:** 
       - Simulate Rnd drag/resize -> verify layout state updates via hook

4. **Context Testing**:
   - Test LoggerContext provider and consumer behavior
   - Verify context values are properly passed to components
   - Test context updates and their effects on dependent components
   - **Specific Context Testing Plan**:
     - Render consumer -> verify received values (`events`, `clearLog`, `logEvent`)
     - Test provider props (`maxLogSize`, `redirectEventsToConsole`) -> verify manager methods called (mock manager singleton)
     - Mock manager -> emit `new-event`/`log-cleared` -> verify context `events` state updates
     - Call context `clearLog` -> verify manager `clearLog` called

Use React Testing Library as the primary testing tool. Organize tests in a structure that mirrors the package's component hierarchy. Mock external dependencies as needed. Aim for at least 80% test coverage.

# Test Strategy:
The implementation will be verified through the following approach:

1. **Code Review**:
   - Verify test files exist for all components, hooks, and contexts
   - Check that tests follow React Testing Library best practices
   - Ensure tests are well-organized and maintainable

2. **Test Coverage Analysis**:
   - Run coverage reports to ensure at least 80% code coverage
   - Identify and address any gaps in test coverage
   - Verify all critical paths are tested

3. **Test Quality Verification**:
   - Confirm tests include positive and negative scenarios
   - Verify edge cases are covered
   - Check that tests are deterministic (no flaky tests)

4. **Specific Test Cases to Verify**:
   - Hook initialization and state management
   - Component rendering with various prop combinations
   - Error states and boundary conditions
   - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
   - Context provider behavior and consumer updates
   - Accessibility compliance
   - **Hook-Specific Test Cases**:
     - For `useComponentLayout`: Initial state, visibility toggling, position updates, size updates, boundary conditions
     - For `useEventFiltering`: Filter application, text search, source/level filtering, combined filters, filter reset
   - **Component-Specific Test Cases**:
     - For `GameEventLog`: Prop variations, context integration, conditional rendering, state-based visibility
     - For `TreeNode`: Node structure rendering, source filtering, styling based on active sources
   - **Interaction-Specific Test Cases**:
     - Event handling: Manager events to UI updates, console hijacking, source filtering
     - UI controls: Clear button, visibility toggle, lock button, tree/details toggle
     - Window management: Drag and resize operations

5. **CI Integration**:
   - Ensure tests run successfully in the CI pipeline
   - Verify tests complete in a reasonable time

6. **Testing Tools**:
   - Use `renderHook` and `act` from React Testing Library for hook testing
   - Implement appropriate mocks for dependencies
   - Use mock functions to verify context and manager interactions

# Implementation Plan for Task 22.1: CommunicationManager Test Suite

**File:** `packages\logger-ui\src\CommunicationManager.test.ts`

**Testing Framework:** Vitest (based on `vitest.config.ts` in the package)

**Setup:**
1.  Import `CommunicationManager`, `EventLogEntry`, and necessary Vitest functions (`describe`, `it`, `expect`, `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, `vi`).
2.  Use `beforeEach` and `afterEach` to manage the singleton instance:
    *   `beforeEach`: Reset Vitest mocks (`vi.resetModules()`), dynamically import `CommunicationManager` to get a fresh module scope, get the instance. Mock `Date.now()` for consistent timestamps. Mock `window` and `window.__console_log_original`.
    *   `afterEach`: Call `CommunicationManager.getInstance().destroy()` to clean up listeners, explicitly delete the static instance (`delete (CommunicationManager as any).instance;`) to ensure isolation. Restore mocks (`vi.restoreAllMocks()`).

**Test Cases:**

1.  **Singleton Pattern (`getInstance`)**:
    *   `it('should return the same instance')`: Call `getInstance()` multiple times and assert the returned objects are strictly equal.
    *   `it('should create a new instance if none exists')`: Verify instance creation on first call.

2.  **`logEvent` Method**:
    *   `it('should add a log entry with correct structure')`: Call `logEvent`, then `getEventLog`, check array length and the structure/content of the added entry (timestamp, source, eventName, data).
    *   `it('should emit "new-event" with the log entry')`: Spy on `emit`, call `logEvent`, verify `emit` was called with `'new-event'` and the correct entry.
    *   `it('should handle different data types (object, array, primitive, null)')`: Test `logEvent` with various data types and verify they are stored correctly.
    *   `it('should trim the log when maxLogSize is exceeded')`: Set `maxLogSize` low, add more events than the limit, verify `getEventLog` returns only the last N entries. Check trimming behavior (should keep *last* N).
    *   `it('should redirect to original console.log when enabled')`: Set `redirectEventsToConsole(true)`, mock `window.__console_log_original`, spy on it, call `logEvent`, verify the mock was called with correct formatting.
    *   `it('should not redirect to console when disabled')`: Set `redirectEventsToConsole(false)`, spy on mock `window.__console_log_original`, verify it was NOT called.

3.  **`clearLog` Method**:
    *   `it('should clear the event log')`: Add events, call `clearLog`, verify `getEventLog` returns an empty array.
    *   `it('should emit "log-cleared" event')`: Spy on `emit`, call `clearLog`, verify `emit` was called with `'log-cleared'`. 

4.  **Event Listeners (`on`, `off`, `emit`)**:
    *   `it('should register and trigger event listeners using "on"')`: Register a listener using `on`, `emit` the event, verify the listener callback was executed.
    *   `it('should remove event listeners using "off"')`: Register a listener, remove it using `off`, emit the event, verify the listener was NOT called.

5.  **Configuration (`setMaxLogSize`, `setRedirectEventsToConsole`)**:
    *   `it('should update maxLogSize')`: Call `setMaxLogSize`, check the internal `_maxLogSize` (or use the getter `maxLogSize`) and verify it trims the log immediately if needed. Test with valid and invalid (negative, zero) inputs, ensuring validation works.
    *   `it('should log the maxLogSize change')`: Spy on `logEvent`, call `setMaxLogSize`, verify `logEvent` was called with appropriate details.
    *   `it('should update redirectEventsToConsole flag')`: Call `setRedirectEventsToConsole`, check internal `_redirectEventsToConsole` state.
    *   `it('should log the redirect change only when value changes')`: Spy on `logEvent`, call `setRedirectEventsToConsole` multiple times (true -> false -> false -> true), verify `logEvent` is called only when the state actually changes.

6.  **`getEventLog` Method**:
    *   `it('should return a copy of the event log array')`: Get the log, modify the returned array, get the log again, verify the internal log wasn't changed (defensive copy).
    *   `it('should return the current log entries')`: Add events, call `getEventLog`, verify the contents match expected.

7.  **`destroy` Method**:
    *   `it('should remove all listeners')`: Add listeners, call `destroy`, emit events, verify listeners are not called. (Check `listenerCount` goes to 0).
    *   `it('should potentially clean up other resources (if any added later)')` - Placeholder if needed.

**Mocks:**
*   `vi.spyOn(CommunicationManager.prototype, 'emit')`
*   `vi.spyOn(console, 'log')` / `window.__console_log_original` (mock implementation)
*   `vi.useFakeTimers()` and `vi.setSystemTime()` for consistent timestamps in `Date.now()`.
*   Mock `window` object as needed for console redirection tests.
