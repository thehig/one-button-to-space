# Title: Develop Comprehensive Test Suite for logger-ui Package
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a complete test suite for the logger-ui package that covers hook logic, component rendering, user interactions, and context usage using React Testing Library.
# Details:
Implement a comprehensive test suite for the logger-ui package following these requirements:

1. **Hook Testing**:
   - Test all custom hooks in the package (e.g., useLogger, useLoggerContext)
   - Verify hooks properly manage state and respond to changes
   - Test error handling and edge cases
   - **Specific Hook Testing Plan**:
     - **`useComponentLayout`**:
       - Verify layout state management (position, size, visibility)
       - Test initial state, toggle visibility, update position (drag simulation)
       - Test update size (resize simulation) and boundary checks
     - **`useEventFiltering`**:
       - Verify log event filtering logic
       - Test initial state, text filtering (including case sensitivity)
       - Test source filtering, level filtering, combined filters
       - Test filter clearing and input debouncing (if applicable)

2. **Component Testing**:
   - Test all UI components for proper rendering
   - Verify components display correct information based on props
   - Test component lifecycle behaviors
   - Ensure accessibility standards are met
   - **Specific Component Testing Plan**:
     - **`GameEventLog.tsx`**: 
       - Test rendering with prop variations (`startsOpen`, `startsLocked`, `hijackConsoleLogs`, initial layout)
       - Test context wrapping and initial events
       - Verify conditional sections (tree/details)
       - Test visibility/opacity based on state
     - **`TreeNode.tsx`**: 
       - Test rendering with various node structures
       - Test `allowedSources` variations (verify checkbox state)
       - Test `activeSourcesInLog` variations (verify styling)
       - Verify count displays and disabled state

3. **User Interaction Testing**:
   - Test all interactive elements (buttons, inputs, etc.)
   - Verify event handlers are called with correct parameters
   - Test keyboard navigation and shortcuts
   - Simulate user actions and verify expected outcomes
   - **Specific Interaction/Integration Tests (GameEventLog focus)**:
     - **Event Handling:** 
       - Simulate `new-event` from manager -> verify UI updates
       - Test `console.log` hijack -> verify context `logEvent` called & UI updates
       - Test new source event -> verify filter tree updates
     - **Filtering:** 
       - Test text input -> verify list filters
       - Test `TreeNode` checkbox clicks -> verify `allowedSources` updates & list filters
       - Test parent/child checkbox logic
     - **UI Controls:** 
       - Test clear button -> verify `clearLog` called & UI clears
       - Test toggle visibility -> verify state change & window visibility
       - Test lock button -> verify state change & Rnd props toggle
       - Test toggle tree/details -> verify sections visibility
     - **Window Management:** 
       - Simulate Rnd drag/resize -> verify layout state updates via hook

4. **Context Testing**:
   - Test LoggerContext provider and consumer behavior
   - Verify context values are properly passed to components
   - Test context updates and their effects on dependent components
   - **Specific Context Testing Plan**:
     - Render consumer -> verify received values (`events`, `clearLog`, `logEvent`)
     - Test provider props (`maxLogSize`, `redirectEventsToConsole`) -> verify manager methods called (mock manager singleton)
     - Mock manager -> emit `new-event`/`log-cleared` -> verify context `events` state updates
     - Call context `clearLog` -> verify manager `clearLog` called

Use React Testing Library as the primary testing tool. Organize tests in a structure that mirrors the package's component hierarchy. Mock external dependencies as needed. Aim for at least 80% test coverage.

# Test Strategy:
The implementation will be verified through the following approach:

1. **Code Review**:
   - Verify test files exist for all components, hooks, and contexts
   - Check that tests follow React Testing Library best practices
   - Ensure tests are well-organized and maintainable

2. **Test Coverage Analysis**:
   - Run coverage reports to ensure at least 80% code coverage
   - Identify and address any gaps in test coverage
   - Verify all critical paths are tested

3. **Test Quality Verification**:
   - Confirm tests include positive and negative scenarios
   - Verify edge cases are covered
   - Check that tests are deterministic (no flaky tests)

4. **Specific Test Cases to Verify**:
   - Hook initialization and state management
   - Component rendering with various prop combinations
   - Error states and boundary conditions
   - User interactions (clicks, inputs, etc.)
   - Context provider behavior and consumer updates
   - Accessibility compliance
   - **Hook-Specific Test Cases**:
     - For `useComponentLayout`: Initial state, visibility toggling, position updates, size updates, boundary conditions
     - For `useEventFiltering`: Filter application, text search, source/level filtering, combined filters, filter reset
   - **Component-Specific Test Cases**:
     - For `GameEventLog`: Prop variations, context integration, conditional rendering, state-based visibility
     - For `TreeNode`: Node structure rendering, source filtering, styling based on active sources
   - **Interaction-Specific Test Cases**:
     - Event handling: Manager events to UI updates, console hijacking, source filtering
     - UI controls: Clear button, visibility toggle, lock button, tree/details toggle
     - Window management: Drag and resize operations

5. **CI Integration**:
   - Ensure tests run successfully in the CI pipeline
   - Verify tests complete in a reasonable time

6. **Testing Tools**:
   - Use `renderHook` and `act` from React Testing Library for hook testing
   - Implement appropriate mocks for dependencies
   - Use mock functions to verify context and manager interactions

    { id: '2', timestamp: '2023-01-01T12:01:00Z', level: 'ERROR', source: 'api/auth', message: 'Authentication failed' },
    { id: '3', timestamp: '2023-01-01T12:02:00Z', level: 'WARN', source: 'api/users/profile', message: 'Profile update incomplete' }
  ];

  const mockSourceTree: SourceTreeNode[] = [
    { 
      id: 'api', 
      name: 'api', 
      children: [
        { id: 'api/users', name: 'users', children: [
          { id: 'api/users/profile', name: 'profile', children: [] }
        ]},
        { id: 'api/auth', name: 'auth', children: [] }
      ]
    }
  ];

  test('parent node toggling affects all descendants', () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useEventFiltering(mockEvents, mockSourceTree));
    
    // Toggle parent node off
    act(() => {
      result.current.handleSourceTreeToggle('api');
    });
    
    // Verify all child sources are filtered out
    expect(result.current.filteredEvents).toHaveLength(0);
    expect(result.current.allowedSources).not.toContain('api/users');
    expect(result.current.allowedSources).not.toContain('api/users/profile');
    expect(result.current.allowedSources).not.toContain('api/auth');
  });

  test('debounces text filter input', async () => {
    jest.useFakeTimers();
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useEventFiltering(mockEvents, mockSourceTree));
    
    act(() => {
      result.current.setFilterName('user');
    });
    
    // Before debounce timeout
    expect(result.current.filterName).toBe('user');
    expect(result.current.filteredEvents).toEqual(mockEvents); // Still showing all events
    
    // After debounce timeout
    act(() => {
      jest.advanceTimersByTime(300); // Assuming 300ms debounce
    });
    
    expect(result.current.filteredEvents).toHaveLength(2); // Only user-related events
    jest.useRealTimers();
  });

  test('handles empty event array gracefully', () => {
    const { result } = renderHook(() => useEventFiltering([], mockSourceTree));
    
    expect(result.current.filteredEvents).toHaveLength(0);
    expect(result.current.eventsCountBySource).toEqual({});
    
    // Should not throw when filtering empty array
    act(() => {
      result.current.setFilterName('test');
      result.current.handleSourceTreeToggle('api');
    });
    
    expect(result.current.filteredEvents).toHaveLength(0);
  });
}
```

The implementation includes proper memoization testing, debounce verification with timer mocking, and comprehensive edge case handling. Tests verify both the filtering logic and the performance optimizations in the hook.
