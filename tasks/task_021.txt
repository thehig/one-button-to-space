# Task ID: 21
# Title: Optimize Client Application Lifecycle with HMR-Compatible Game Manager Reset
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Refactor the client application startup/lifecycle to implement best practices for Hot Module Replacement (HMR), ensuring game managers reset appropriately during development and maintaining lifecycle integrity for future changes.
# Details:
This task involves a comprehensive review and optimization of the client application's startup and lifecycle processes, with a focus on making it work seamlessly with Hot Module Replacement during development. The developer should:

1. Document the current application startup sequence and game manager initialization flow
2. Identify all game managers and state containers that need proper resetting during HMR
3. Implement a centralized lifecycle management system that:
   - Properly disposes resources when HMR triggers
   - Reinitializes game managers with appropriate state
   - Prevents memory leaks during repeated HMR cycles
4. Create clear separation between initialization, runtime, and cleanup phases
5. Add lifecycle hooks that future components can implement to participate in the lifecycle
6. Implement a registry pattern for game managers to ensure they're properly tracked
7. Add safeguards to prevent multiple initializations or partial state during HMR
8. Create developer-friendly console logging for lifecycle events during development
9. Document the new lifecycle flow with sequence diagrams for future developers
10. Update existing game managers to implement the new lifecycle hooks

The implementation should be backward compatible with existing code while providing a clear path for future components to follow the lifecycle pattern.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both the correctness of the lifecycle implementation and its resilience to HMR cycles:

1. Unit Tests:
   - Create tests for each lifecycle phase (init, reset, dispose)
   - Verify game managers properly implement lifecycle hooks
   - Test edge cases like rapid HMR cycles or partial initialization

2. Integration Tests:
   - Simulate complete application startup and verify all managers initialize correctly
   - Trigger mock HMR events and verify proper cleanup and reinitialization
   - Verify no memory leaks occur after multiple HMR cycles using memory profiling

3. Manual Testing:
   - Perform actual development with HMR enabled, making code changes to trigger reloads
   - Verify game state is appropriately maintained or reset as expected
   - Test with various game states (menu, gameplay, etc.) when HMR triggers
   - Verify console logs show proper lifecycle execution

4. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure existing functionality works without changes after implementation
   - Verify application startup performance isn't negatively impacted

5. Documentation Verification:
   - Review lifecycle documentation for completeness
   - Have another developer attempt to implement a new manager using only the documentation

# Subtasks:
## 1. Document Current Application Lifecycle and Create Manager Registry [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Document the existing application startup sequence, game manager initialization flow, and implement a registry pattern for tracking all game managers, with special attention to Phaser/MatterJS lifecycle considerations.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Create a detailed flowchart of the current application startup sequence
2. Document all existing game managers and their initialization methods
3. Document Phaser/MatterJS specific lifecycle events and cleanup requirements
4. Implement a `GameManagerRegistry` class that will:
   - Maintain a collection of all game managers
   - Provide registration/deregistration methods
   - Include a method to iterate through all registered managers
   - Track Phaser-specific and MatterJS-specific objects for proper cleanup
5. Modify existing game managers to register themselves with the registry
6. Add console logging to track registration events during development
7. Document best practices for Phaser/MatterJS cleanup during HMR cycles

Testing approach:
- Verify all existing game managers are properly registered
- Check console logs to ensure registration events are captured
- Manually test that the registry correctly tracks all game managers
- Verify Phaser and MatterJS objects are properly tracked for cleanup

## 2. Design and Implement Lifecycle Interface and Hooks [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.1
### Description: Create a standardized lifecycle interface with hooks for initialization, runtime, and cleanup phases that all game managers will implement, with rigorous cleanup procedures for Phaser/MatterJS objects.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Define a `LifecycleAware` interface with methods:
   - `initialize()`: Setup resources and state
   - `onActive()`: Called when component becomes active
   - `onInactive()`: Called when component becomes inactive
   - `dispose()`: Cleanup resources to prevent memory leaks
2. Add Phaser/MatterJS specific cleanup methods to the interface:
   - `cleanupPhaserObjects()`: Remove sprites, game objects, input handlers
   - `cleanupMatterObjects()`: Remove bodies, constraints, collision listeners
   - `cleanupEventListeners()`: Remove all event listeners (Phaser, Matter, custom)
   - `cleanupTimers()`: Cancel all active timers and scheduled callbacks
3. Create a `LifecycleManager` class that orchestrates lifecycle events
4. Integrate the lifecycle manager with the game manager registry
5. Implement developer-friendly console logging for lifecycle events
6. Add safeguards to prevent multiple initializations
7. Ensure MatterJS world simulation is properly paused/resumed with lifecycle events

Testing approach:
- Create test components implementing the lifecycle interface
- Verify all lifecycle hooks are called in the correct order
- Test edge cases like multiple initialization attempts
- Check console output for clear lifecycle event logging
- Verify Phaser and MatterJS objects are properly cleaned up during disposal

## 3. Implement HMR Detection and Cleanup Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 21.2
### Description: Add logic to detect Hot Module Replacement events and properly dispose resources before the application reloads, with special focus on Phaser/MatterJS cleanup and multiplayer state resynchronization.
### Details:
Implementation steps:
1. Research and implement HMR event detection for the current framework
2. Create an `HmrHandler` class that listens for HMR events
3. Connect the HMR handler to the lifecycle manager to trigger cleanup
4. Implement a complete disposal sequence that:
   - Calls `dispose()` on all registered game managers
   - Ensures all Phaser objects are properly destroyed
   - Removes all MatterJS bodies and constraints from the physics world
   - Clears any global state or event listeners
   - Pauses MatterJS world simulation
   - Logs cleanup operations to console during development
5. Add error handling to ensure partial cleanups don't break the application
6. Implement server state resynchronization after HMR rather than client-side state preservation
7. Add hooks for multiplayer reconnection/state refresh after HMR completion

Testing approach:
- Test in development environment with HMR enabled
- Verify resources are properly cleaned up during HMR (check memory usage)
- Ensure no console errors appear during multiple HMR cycles
