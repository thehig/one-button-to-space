# Task ID: 6
# Title: Integrate Phaser with React in Client
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Phaser within the React application and create the basic scene structure.
# Details:
Install Phaser in the client package. Create a PhaserGame component in React that initializes and manages the Phaser game instance. Set up basic scene classes (BootScene, MainMenuScene, GameScene) following Phaser's lifecycle methods. Create a container div in the React component to mount the Phaser canvas. Implement proper cleanup in the React component's useEffect hook to prevent memory leaks during component unmounting.

# Test Strategy:
Verify Phaser initializes correctly within the React application. Check that scenes load properly and the game canvas renders. Test component mounting/unmounting to ensure proper cleanup.
