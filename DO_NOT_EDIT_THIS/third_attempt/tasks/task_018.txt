# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Visual Effects and Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: low
# Description: Create visual effects for thrusters, explosions, and the space environment.
# Details:
Implement animated thruster effects tied to input state. Create explosion animations for collisions. Implement a procedural star field background using a deterministic seeded approach. Add visual indicators for gravity wells and atmospheric boundaries. Implement particle effects for atmospheric entry.

# Test Strategy:
Verify visual effects trigger at appropriate times. Check that animations play correctly and clean up properly. Test procedural generation consistency across different clients.
