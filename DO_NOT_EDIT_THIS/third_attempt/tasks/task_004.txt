# Task ID: 4
# Title: Set Up Server Package with Node.js, Express, and Colyseus
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the server package with Node.js, Express, and Colyseus for WebSocket communication.
# Details:
In the server directory, initialize a new Node.js project. Install Express, Colyseus, and related dependencies. Create a basic server.ts file that sets up an Express application and integrates Colyseus for WebSocket handling. Configure scripts for development (with nodemon) and production builds. Set up a basic HTTP endpoint for health checks.

# Test Strategy:
Run the server and verify it starts without errors. Test the health check endpoint with a simple HTTP request. Verify Colyseus is properly initialized by checking server logs.
