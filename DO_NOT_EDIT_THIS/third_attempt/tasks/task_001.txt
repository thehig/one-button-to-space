# Task ID: 1
# Title: Initialize pnpm Monorepo Structure
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up the initial monorepo structure with client, server, and shared packages using pnpm workspaces.
# Details:
Create a new directory for the project. Initialize pnpm workspace by creating a pnpm-workspace.yaml file in the root with packages defined as ['client', 'server', 'shared']. Set up package.json in the root with workspace configuration. Create subdirectories for each package with their own package.json files. Configure root-level scripts for building and running all packages.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that pnpm workspaces are correctly configured by running 'pnpm install' and confirming dependencies are hoisted appropriately. Ensure packages can reference each other using the workspace protocol.
