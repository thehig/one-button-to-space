# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Client-Side Prediction and Reconciliation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10, 11
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add client-side prediction and server reconciliation for smooth multiplayer experience.
# Details:
In the NetworkManager, implement input sequence numbering and buffering. Add client-side prediction by applying inputs locally before server confirmation. Implement server reconciliation by comparing server state with predicted state and correcting discrepancies. Add interpolation for remote player entities to smooth movement between state updates. Implement a replay system for re-applying inputs after reconciliation.

# Test Strategy:
Test with artificial network latency to verify prediction and reconciliation. Check visual smoothness of local and remote player movement. Verify recovery from prediction errors.
