# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Rocket Controls - Thrust and World Tilt
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the core control mechanisms: single-touch thrust and device tilt for rocket orientation via server communication.
# Details:
Implement touch/click event listeners to send 'thrust_start' and 'thrust_stop' events to the server when the rocket's main thruster is activated/deactivated. Set up accelerometer API integration to detect device tilt and send 'set_angle' events to the server. Implement spacebar as fallback control for thrust on desktop. The Rocket class should toggle a visual flame effect based on the 'isThrusting' state received from the server. The rocket's orientation will be controlled by the target angle received from the server based on device tilt data.

# Test Strategy:
Test thrust activation on both touch and click events, verifying 'thrust_start' and 'thrust_stop' events are sent to the server. Verify that the rocket's flame effect toggles correctly based on server 'isThrusting' state. Test accelerometer integration on mobile devices, ensuring 'set_angle' events are sent to the server. Verify spacebar fallback control works properly for thrust on desktop. Confirm the rocket rotates to the correct orientation based on server responses to tilt input.
