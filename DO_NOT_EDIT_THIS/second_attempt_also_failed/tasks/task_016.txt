# Task ID: 16
# Title: Upgrade Rocket Visuals and Implement Precise Collision Detection
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Replace the placeholder rocket graphic with a high-quality image asset, implement a mesh-based collision detection system, and add animated thruster effects to enhance gameplay visuals and physics.
# Details:
This task involves three main components:

1. **Rocket Asset Replacement**:
   - Source or create a detailed rocket image asset (recommended dimensions: 128x256px with transparent background)
   - Implement the new asset in the game's rendering system
   - Ensure proper scaling and rotation of the new asset
   - Maintain the rocket's center of mass at the appropriate position

2. **Mesh-based Collision Detection**:
   - Create a collision mesh that closely follows the contours of the new rocket asset
   - Replace the current collision detection system (likely using simple shapes) with a mesh-based approach
   - Implement efficient collision detection algorithms suitable for real-time gameplay
   - Ensure collision response physics remain consistent with game design
   - Add appropriate hitbox visualization for debug mode

3. **Animated Thruster Effects**:
   - Create or source a sprite sheet for thruster animation (recommended: 4-8 frames)
   - Implement animation system for the thruster effects
   - Tie animation state to player input (e.g., more intense animation when thrust is higher)
   - Ensure proper positioning of thruster effects relative to the rocket
   - Add appropriate particle effects to enhance the visual appeal

Performance considerations: The mesh-based collision should be optimized to maintain frame rate. Consider using simplified collision meshes rather than pixel-perfect collision if performance issues arise.

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Visual Upgrade:** Replaced placeholder rectangle with `rocket.png` for improved visual fidelity. Player-specific coloring retained via `setTint()` for differentiation, choosing this over complex shaders for simplicity.
- **Collision Accuracy:** Replaced rectangular physics body with a more accurate 7-point vertex-based shape (`fromVertices`) derived from the asset image to improve collision detection. Iteratively adjusted vertices and visual offset (`visualOffsetY`) to align physics and visual representation. Moved vertex definition to shared package for client-server consistency.
- **Physics/Visual Link:** Removed client-side visual interpolation (decoupling `gameObject` from `targetX/Y/Angle`). Visuals now directly mirror the (server-corrected) physics body state, prioritizing physics accuracy over potential visual smoothing.
- **Thruster Effect:** Replaced static graphics thruster with a flickering `Sprite` using two images (`thruster_001.png`, `thruster_002.png`) as a preliminary animated effect. Adjusted position, scale, depth, and flicker rate based on visual feedback. Particle effects deferred.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify all three components function correctly:

1. **Visual Testing**:
   - Verify the rocket asset displays correctly at different screen resolutions
   - Confirm the rocket rotates smoothly without visual artifacts
   - Ensure the thruster animation plays correctly when thrust is applied
   - Check that the animation intensity corresponds to thrust level
   - Verify thruster position remains fixed relative to the rocket during movement

2. **Collision Testing**:
   - Test collision detection with various game objects (asteroids, power-ups, boundaries)
   - Verify collisions are detected accurately at the visual edges of the rocket
   - Test edge cases: high-speed collisions, glancing collisions, multi-point collisions
   - Ensure no false positives/negatives in collision detection
   - Measure performance impact of new collision system (should maintain target FPS)

3. **Integration Testing**:
   - Verify rocket controls remain responsive with new visuals
   - Test game balance hasn't been affected by collision changes
   - Ensure save/load functionality works with the new rocket implementation
   - Test on minimum spec hardware to verify performance
   - Verify the physics-visual coupling works correctly with server corrections
   - Test player color tinting across different game scenarios

Create a debug visualization toggle to display collision meshes during testing.
