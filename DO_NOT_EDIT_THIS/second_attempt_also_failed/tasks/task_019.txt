# Task ID: 19
# Title: Implement Server-Authoritative Physics System with Client Prediction
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Design and implement a server-authoritative physics system that maintains game state integrity while providing responsive client experiences through prediction and reconciliation techniques.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a comprehensive server-authoritative physics system with the following components:

1. Server-side physics implementation:
   - Implement deterministic physics calculations on the server as the source of truth
   - Set up a fixed timestep physics update loop independent of network tick rate
   - Create data structures for efficiently storing and processing physics state

2. Client-side prediction:
   - Implement local physics simulation that mirrors server logic
   - Apply local inputs immediately while tracking input sequence numbers
   - Store recent input history and predicted states for reconciliation
   - Use interpolation for non-controlled entities

3. Server reconciliation:
   - Send authoritative state updates with corresponding input sequence numbers
   - Implement state correction that smoothly transitions from incorrect to correct states
   - Add jitter buffer to handle network inconsistencies
   - Implement adaptive error thresholds based on network conditions

4. State synchronization optimization:
   - Implement delta compression to send only changed values
   - Add relevancy filtering based on player proximity/visibility
   - Set up variable update rates based on entity importance
   - Use quantization to reduce bandwidth requirements

5. Input validation:
   - Implement server-side validation of all client inputs
   - Add anti-cheat measures to detect physics manipulation
   - Create rate limiting for inputs to prevent flooding
   - Design graceful handling of rejected inputs

The implementation should prioritize security while maintaining a responsive feel for players, even under suboptimal network conditions.

# Test Strategy:
Testing should verify both correctness and performance of the physics system:

1. Functional testing:
   - Unit test physics calculations on both client and server to ensure identical results
   - Verify reconciliation correctly handles state divergence by artificially introducing errors
   - Test input validation by sending malformed or impossible inputs
   - Confirm delta compression correctly transmits only changed values

2. Performance testing:
   - Measure bandwidth usage with and without optimizations under various player counts
   - Profile CPU usage on both client and server during high-activity scenarios
   - Test memory consumption over extended play sessions

3. Network condition testing:
   - Simulate various network conditions (packet loss, latency, jitter) using network simulation tools
   - Verify system degrades gracefully under poor conditions
   - Test reconnection scenarios and state recovery

4. Integration testing:
   - Verify physics interactions between multiple clients work correctly
   - Test edge cases like rapid direction changes and collision scenarios
   - Ensure synchronization remains stable during extended gameplay

5. User experience testing:
   - Conduct blind tests comparing local-only vs. networked physics to assess perceived responsiveness
   - Measure and minimize visible correction artifacts
   - Verify the system feels responsive across various network conditions

Document baseline metrics before and after implementation to quantify improvements.
