# Task ID: 8
# Title: Create Game UI and Feedback Systems
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the user interface elements and feedback mechanisms for gameplay.
# Details:
Design and implement a heads-up display (HUD) showing relevant information (e.g., mission objectives). Create visual indicators for physics states (gravity strength, atmospheric density). Implement feedback for player actions (thrust activation, successful/failed landing). Design and implement mission briefing and completion screens. Add basic tutorial elements to explain controls and mechanics. Create a pause menu with options to restart or quit missions.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that all UI elements display correctly across different screen sizes. Test that physics state indicators accurately reflect the game state. Ensure feedback is clear and timely for player actions. Test that mission screens and menus function as expected.
