# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository and Development Environment
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize the project repository with TypeScript, set up the build pipeline, and configure the basic project structure.
# Details:
Create a new TypeScript project using Vite for faster performance and simpler configuration. Initialize the project with a Vite template using `npm create vite@latest your-project-name -- --template vanilla-ts` which handles initial TypeScript setup, basic structure, and dev server configuration. Install necessary dependencies via npm/yarn including a physics engine (Matter.js or Planck.js) and a rendering library (Phaser.js or Pixi.js). Create folder structure for assets, src/game, src/physics, src/ui, and utilities. Set up a basic HTML template with a canvas element.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the Vite development environment builds successfully and runs in a browser. Test that TypeScript compilation works correctly. Ensure that the chosen physics and rendering libraries can be imported and used in the project. Confirm that the development server starts without errors and hot module replacement works as expected.
