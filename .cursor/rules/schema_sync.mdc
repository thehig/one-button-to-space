-   **Critical: Update Duplicated Schema File**
    -   The schema definition file `State.ts` is manually duplicated between the server and client packages.
    -   **Server Source:** [`packages\server\src\schema\State.ts`](mdc:packages/server/src/schema/State.ts)
    -   **Client Copy:** [`packages\client\src\schema\State.ts`](mdc:packages/client/src/schema/State.ts)

-   **ðŸš¨ Action Required When Editing:**
    -   If you modify `packages\server\src\schema\State.ts`, you **MUST** manually copy the *entire updated content* to `packages\client\src\schema\State.ts`.
    -   If you (incorrectly) modify `packages\client\src\schema\State.ts`, you **MUST** manually copy the *entire updated content* back to `packages\server\src\schema\State.ts`.
    -   **The server version is considered the source of truth.** Prefer editing the server file and copying to the client.

-   **Reasoning:**
    -   These files define the shared application state using `@colyseus/schema`.
    -   They must be identical for the client and server to communicate correctly.
    -   Failure to keep them synchronized will lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

-   **Reminder Comments:**
    -   Look for the prominent warning comments at the top of each file:
        ```typescript
        /**
         * ! THIS FILE IS DUPLICATED IN THE CLIENT PACKAGE ...
         * ! WHEN EDITING, MAKE SURE TO UPDATE THE CLIENT VERSION AS WELL
         */
        ```
        ```typescript
        /**
         * ! THIS FILE IS COPIED FROM THE SERVER PACKAGE ...
         * ! DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY ...
         * ! EDIT THE SERVER VERSION INSTEAD ...
         */
        ```
