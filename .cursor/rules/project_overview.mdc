## Development Workflow (Task-Based)

1.  **Select Task:** Identify the next task using `next_task`.
2.  **Set Status:** Mark the chosen task/subtask as `in-progress` using `set_task_status`.
3.  **Implement:** Work on the code changes required for the task.
4.  **Commit Changes:**
    -   Make one or more logical commits for the changes. Use clear commit messages referencing the task/subtask ID.
5.  **Verify:** Ensure the implementation meets task requirements and passes any relevant tests (see [`tests.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/tests.mdc)).
6.  **Mark Done:** Set the task/subtask status to `done` using `set_task_status`.
7.  **Final Commit:** Make a final commit marking the task as complete.

## Critical Reminders for LLMs

-   **🛑 STOP 🛑: ALWAYS ASK FOR USER INPUT BEFORE STARTING A NEW TASK.**
    -   Do not assume you should proceed to the next task automatically.
    -   Confirm with the user before using `next_task` or selecting any task not explicitly assigned.

-   **🛑 STOP 🛑: ONLY MODIFY FILES RELEVANT TO THE CURRENT TASK.**
    -   Do not make unrelated changes to files outside the scope of the active task/subtask.
    -   If changes to other files seem absolutely necessary, **ASK THE USER FOR PERMISSION FIRST.** Explain why you think the change is needed.

-   **‼️ VERY IMPORTANT: ALWAYS USE WINDOWS PATHING ‼️**
    -   **Use backslashes (`\`) for directory separators.** Example: `src\components\Button.tsx`
    -   **DO NOT use forward slashes (`/`)**.
    -   This applies to all file paths provided in prompts, tool calls, code generation, and explanations.

## Testing Guidance

-   **User-Driven Testing:** Heavily rely on the user for testing at all stages.
    -   Do not assume functionality works without user confirmation.
    -   Proactively ask the user to test specific features or changes.
    -   Inquire about edge cases or specific scenarios the user wants tested.
-   Refer to [`tests.mdc`](mdc:.cursor/rules/tests.mdc) for general testing strategies, but prioritize user feedback and specific requests.
